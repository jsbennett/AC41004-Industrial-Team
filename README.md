# AC41004 - Industrial Team Project
## Introduction
The Industrial Team Project task was to represent time-based, geo-location tracking information on [WRLD3D maps](https://www.wrld3d.com/).

## FRM3D
FRM3D is an interactive way for farmers to view their crops to help them make decisive decisions about how to manage their resources. 
Currently for each field, farmers can see what crop is growing in what field, their expected harvest date, soil moisture and ph levels. 
They can also see the weather for their farm, all the crops and their expected harvest dates in one place, and graphs showing the analysis of the weather and crop history. 

## Getting Started 
To have a look at FRM3D, follow the steps below:
